Considerations:
- morning routine/evening routine buttons -> route to routines/morning || routines/evening respectively
    - should solve routine display (morning/evening) issue
    - will have to build out new views for morning/evening routine (should just be copy paste of routine view)

- Mood page:
    - figure out how to add point value to each face -> set point value in rewards.state.pointValue
      - if that works: figure out which rewards to display depending on point value threshold
      - seed rewards data
    - if all else fails, ditch mood page and you will still have morning/evening routine pages as extra pages to fill capstone requirement
      - consider making mood page a modal if time allows
